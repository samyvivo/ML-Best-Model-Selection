# ML-Best-Model-Selection

Machine Learning Model Selection Analysis üß†

How to identify the best model for machine learning? ü§î What is the concept of overfit and underfit? Here, I tried to explain this concept simply with a simple example and using different algorithms.

hashtag#Data_Definition:

X = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

y = [3000, 4000, 4500, 5000, 7000, 7800, 7900, 9000, 9200, 10000, 20000 ]
- Input variable (X): Years of experience (values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom no experience to 10 years of experience)
- Target variable (y): Relevant income values ‚Äã‚Äã(from a base of $3,000 to $20,000)

1Ô∏è‚É£(Linear Regression) Linear Regression

- Simple linear relationship between experience and income.
- Produces a straight line fit.
- Underfits the data and provides a nonlinear model.

Simple regression predicted values:
Year 10: $13,945
Year 15: $19,945
Year 20: $25,945
Year 100: $121,945

2Ô∏è‚É£ (Polynomial Regression)
- Nonlinear relationship between experience and income
- Polynomial transformation (here degree 3) is used
- Provides a better fit to the data than simple linear regression

Multinomial regression predicted values:
Year 10: $17,889
Year 15: $74,922
Year 20: $216,406
Year 100: $45,588,043

3Ô∏è‚É£ (Random Forest Regression)
- Provides a better fit than the previous two models.
- Predicted values ‚Äã‚Äãclosely match the actual data points.

Random Forest Prior Values:
Year 10: $16,378
Year 15: $16,378
Year 20: $16,378
Year 100: $16,378

4Ô∏è‚É£ (XGBOOST Regression) XGBOOST Regressor
- Able to capture complex patterns.
- Shows the best fit of all models.
- Predicted values ‚Äã‚Äãmatch the actual data points "perfectly".

Previous XGBOOST values:
Year 10: $19,999
Year 15: $19,999
Year 20: $19,999
Year 100: $19,999

hashtag#final_conclusion
-As you can see from the figures and predicted values, more complex models such as random forest and XGBOOST (tree-based) perform very well in modeling the data, but they completely fail in predicting the values ‚Äã‚Äãof subsequent years (after ten years), so that they cannot predict at all and only provide a fixed value.

-Polynomial regression (with degree 3) performs better than simple regression in modeling, but again in predicting this simple regression has the best performance.

-So more complex models with more variance do not necessarily perform better, but sometimes models with more bias and simplicity perform best.
Choosing the right machine learning model depends on several factors, including the type of data, the type of problem, the size of the dataset, interpretability needs, and computational resources. Here is a structured approach to choosing the best model:
1. Understand the type of problem
2. Consider the characteristics of the data
3. Evaluate the performance of the model
4. Consider computational cost and interpretability
5. Practical workflow for model selection

scikit-learn has a page called the Machine Learning Roadmap, known among programmers in this field as the scikit learn cheat sheet, which can help you a lot in choosing the right model: https://lnkd.in/e3EbYFwj
